📇 Contact Manager using Self-Balancing AVL Tree in Java

✅ Project Components:
AVLTree.java – Core data structure (AVL Tree logic: insert, delete, balance, etc.)
Contact.java – Model class representing a contact (name, phone, email)
ContactAppGUI.java – User interface built using Java Swing for interacting with contacts in the AVL tree

1----📌 Project Overview
A Java-based contact management system powered by a self-balancing AVL Tree, offering real-time operations such as add, delete, update, and search in O(log n) time. Designed with a user-friendly Swing GUI, this project demonstrates the application of advanced data structures for practical software systems.


2----💻 Tech Stack
* Java – Primary programming language
* Java Swing – GUI development
*DSA Concepts – AVL Tree (balanced binary search tree)
*Object-Oriented Design – Modular classes for contact and tree logic

3----🗂️ Project Structure

| File Name            | Purpose                                         |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `Contact.java`       | Contact model class with fields and accessors   |
| `AVLTree.java`       | Implementation of AVL Tree logic                |
| `ContactAppGUI.java` | Swing-based graphical interface for interaction |


4---⚙️ Features & Highlights
 📌 DSA Problem Tackled
     Efficiently managing a growing dataset (contacts) while maintaining sorted order and quick access, which becomes costly using linear or unbalanced tree structures.

🎯 Core Functional Goals
    * Insert contacts and keep them sorted alphabetically
    * Perform delete and search operations with O(log n) complexity
    *Ensure tree remains balanced using AVL rotation logic
    *Enable GUI-based visual management of contact data

🖥️ Key Components
    * AVL Tree Logic: Self-balancing with automatic rotations after insert/delete
    * Search Functionality: Instant lookup by contact name
    * Update Support: Modify existing contact details
    * GUI Interface: Add, delete, search contacts via an interactive Swing form
    * Real-Time Tree Updates: Backend AVL tree updates with every operation

📈 Learning Outcomes & Technical Impact
    * Mastery of recursive algorithms, tree balancing, and DSA in real-world applications
    * Experience designing a modular, interactive Java application
    * Demonstrated skills in data modeling, performance optimization, and GUI integration
    * Ideal for interviews focused on trees, time complexity, and object-oriented design
